Notice how writing is not on here? To be honest, despite having this website, I struggle with writing. So if you catch spelling mistakes or would like to comment on my writing please do 😄.

## Hiking Wishlist

- [ ] Dolly Sods West Virginia
- [ ] Natural Bridge

Eventually I'd like to try a long thru hike. But, as I've come to find out, I might not have good enough knees to support it anymore. More on this struggle later.

## Kayaking Wishlist

- [ ] Overnight camp at an island.
- [ ] 3 day Kayak trip.
- [ ] Climb a big buoy and do a backflip off of it.
- [ ] Safely roll a kayak

## Reading List

Here's my current [reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66568677-miguel-lopez-rivera?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=currently-reading) as well as a list of books I might [want to read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66568677-miguel-lopez-rivera?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read) someday. I'm always available to take recommendations 🤓.
