The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one.

I've also created a command! just type `newpost` in the terminal and this draft page will copy over to the draft post directory!

For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
