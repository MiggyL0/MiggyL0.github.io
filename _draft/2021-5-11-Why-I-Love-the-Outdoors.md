# why I love the outdoors

## outline

first, talk about my early childhood and my first bike
then talk about my big family
then talk about how we used to go to Shenandoah together
talk about the memorable experience with the bear
talk about the time where I slid on my bike and felt really cool

transition into how that affected me throughout my life

and with how I intend to keep this interest and how we going. probably for the rest of my life.
